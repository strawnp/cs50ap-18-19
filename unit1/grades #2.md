# Grades, Take 2

## Prerequisites
None

## Problem
Recall the earlier grading system? Use a switch statement to take in a letter grade, and print out a verbal assessment 
that corresponds to it (e.g. "You got an A! Great job!"). Tip: <code>switch</code>-ing with chars is much the same as switching with ints.

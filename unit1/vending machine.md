# Vending Machine

## Prerequisites
None

## Problem
Switch statements are good for handling multiple options for input -- and responding with many possible cases. Using a switch statement, write a program that emulates a vending machine, in which the following numbers produce the following chocolate bars:  

1 -- Mars; 2 -- Snickers; 3 -- Milky Way; 4 -- Kit Kat; 5 -- Twix; 6 -- Crunch; 7 -- Hershey's; 8 -- 3 Musketeers.  

For our purposes, it is enough to print out the chocolate bar's name (no need to dispense an actual chocolate bar :) ).

## Distribution Code
None
